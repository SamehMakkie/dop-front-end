            Dream of Pixels is initiated by a bunch of EMU Masterâ€™s Degree and
            PhD students. We made this project for our User Interface
            Development course. We are aiming to help TRNC citizens and EMU
            students to have easier and cheaper access to games through DoP Game
            Store.

            feature that allows you to buy multiple games at once and a game
            library where all of your purchased games can be downloaded.

            are no unofficial, unlicensed, clone games, or games with adult
            content in DoP Game Store. All games are in line with international
            regulations and standards. Also, all comments are filtered from
            slang and insults in multiple languages, making DoP Game Store safe
